## Shoutout to the real-deal: [Spritz](http://www.spritzinc.com/)

### Disclaimer:

I built this after watching a SourceFED report on YT on spritzing.

I found it helpend me reach 800WPM on their English demo, and I really wanted to check out how fast I could spritz in my native language.

I'll buy the original as soon as it becomes available on my mobile device. If that'll take too long I'll probably even switch vendor to a follow this app as it is really awesome.

I found that being tired/rested influences spritzing speed greatly (by 100% relative increase in my case when I am rested, versus trying this at 4AM when I actually finished this demo.)

                    This project is not meant to be production ready. There are several parameters that need to become configurable before this could be usable:

*   Slider instead of discrete speed selector
*   Word transitions: smooth, instant(like it is now), morph (i find the current setting to be suboptimal for me, and a smooth fading between words really helps me
*   Better and _localized_ long word breaking
*   Stop char (.,!?:;) delay handling configuration/tweaking
*   Localized word center-weight point detection
*   Center-weight leter color customization
*   Font size, font-family, font-style customization
*   Chapter detection, progress bar, bookmarks - text navigation in general
*   Accept other file formats, not just plain text
*   Allow URLs, not just files so you get web page parsing.
